# BookStore

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.18.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Funcionalities 
Register a new User
Register a new Book
Update a new Book
Delete a new Book

I used material Design + Angular to develop this solution, it is a Bookstore where you can register and coming soon buy a book.
